"""Pre-check diagrams in study notes and say when one has outgrown Mermaid.

Mermaid renders inside Obsidian, so a note can carry a diagram with no
toolchain at all. That only holds while the diagram stays small: past a
certain size Mermaid's layout stops being readable and the diagram belongs in
D2, rendered to SVG and embedded. Deciding that by feel produces tangled
diagrams nobody redraws, so the threshold is counted here instead.

This is a pre-check, not a renderer. Mermaid's own parser is JavaScript and
this repository keeps its scripts dependency-free, so what is checked is the
set of mistakes that are decidable from the text: an unknown diagram type,
unbalanced delimiters, labels Mermaid cannot parse or cannot render as
markdown, and embedded assets that do not exist. A file that passes may still
fail to render.
